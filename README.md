Duration: 52 hours

I created a salary calculator for a business looking to track their monthly salary expense. I created an "add employee field," where new employees are added to a table below. As the employees are added, the company's monthly salary expenses get tallied at the bottom based on the newly added employee's annual salary.

Once the monthly salary expense exceeds the monthly budget of $20,000, an alert prompts in the form of highlighting the monthly salary expenditure in red.
